# JFXTableView_CSS
An attempt to nail down the CSS necessary to have a "JFXTableView" since as of JFoenix 8.0.1, the directive is to merely style a normal TableView.

## Help Wanted
I'm not sure I've got it down pat, so feel free to add on.

[jfx-table-view.css](src/main/resources/tech/ugma/education/jfoenixtableview/jfx-table-view.css)

### Things left to fine tune
 * Scroll Bars
 * Anything else you can think of/see?
 
 
 ## Getting Started

 * On the command line, in the root of the project, type the command `gradlew run`
