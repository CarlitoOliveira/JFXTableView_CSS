You have two options:
 * You can try to replicate the look of the **JFXTreeTableView** ->
[jfx-table-view.css](src/main/resources/tech/ugma/education/jfoenixtableview/jfx-table-view.css)
 * Or you can try to conform to the **Material Design Specifications** ->
[material-design-table-view.css](src/main/resources/tech/ugma/education/jfoenixtableview/material-design-table-view.css)

See how them compare! To try it yourself, clone/download this repository and run `gradlew run` in the root of the project
for a quick demo.


## Help Wanted
Recently the Material Design Guidelines had an updateâ€”consequently the stylesheet will need to be updated to match those
specifications.


### Things left to fine tune
 * New Material Design Specifications
 * Scroll Bars
 * Anything else you can think of/see?

 
 ## Getting Started
 * Clone this repository to your machine
 * On the command line, in the root of the project, type the command `gradlew run`
